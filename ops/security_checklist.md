# AeonPay Security Checklist - OWASP Top 10 Mapping

## A01:2021 – Broken Access Control
- [x] JWT-based authentication with proper token validation
- [x] Scope-based authorization (user, merchant, admin)
- [x] Device binding to prevent session hijacking
- [x] Idempotency keys to prevent replay attacks
- [x] Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- [x] Session fingerprinting and validation

**Routes Protected:**
- `/api/auth/*` - 5 req/min limit
- `/api/payments/*` - 30 req/min limit  
- `/api/swap/*` - 20 req/min limit
- `/api/ai/*` - 15 req/min limit

## A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures
- [x] JWT tokens with secure secrets (configurable via environment)
- [x] Device fingerprinting using SHA-256 hashing
- [x] PII tokenization for AI interactions
- [x] Secure session management
- [ ] HTTPS enforcement in production (handled by Replit)
- [x] Password hashing (when applicable)

## A03:2021 – Injection
- [x] Input validation using Zod schemas
- [x] Parameterized queries via Drizzle ORM
- [x] Content Security Policy headers
- [x] NoSQL injection prevention in storage layer
- [x] Command injection prevention

**CSP Policy:** Restricts script sources, prevents inline eval, blocks objects

## A04:2021 – Insecure Design
- [x] Privacy by design with PII redaction
- [x] AI guardrails preventing unauthorized actions
- [x] Multi-arm bandit testing for safe feature rollouts
- [x] Anti-velocity controls for swap transactions
- [x] Proper error handling without information leakage
- [x] Feature flags for emergency kill switches

## A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration
- [x] Security headers implemented:
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
  - Permissions-Policy
- [x] Error handling without stack trace exposure
- [x] CORS configuration locked to Replit domains
- [x] Environment-based configuration

## A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- [x] Regular dependency updates via npm audit
- [x] CI checks for known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Automated dependency scanning (future enhancement)
- [x] Minimal dependency footprint

**Current Security:**
- Express.js with security middleware
- Rate limiting with express-rate-limit
- CORS protection
- Helmet.js security headers

## A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures
- [x] Multi-factor considerations via device binding
- [x] Session management with fingerprinting
- [x] Account lockout via rate limiting
- [x] Secure session rotation on logout
- [x] Token expiration (7-day JWT lifetime)
- [x] Brute force protection

## A08:2021 – Software and Data Integrity Failures
- [x] CI/CD pipeline with security gates
- [x] Input validation at API boundaries
- [x] Idempotency for critical operations
- [x] Audit logging for privacy events
- [x] Backup and recovery procedures
- [x] Digital signatures for critical data

## A09:2021 – Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
- [x] Structured JSON logging with redaction
- [x] Privacy event audit trail
- [x] Error aggregation and monitoring
- [x] Health check endpoints
- [x] Real-time security event logging
- [x] Performance monitoring

**Monitoring Endpoints:**
- `/health` - Overall system health
- `/health/db` - Database connectivity
- `/health/ai` - AI service status
- `/ops/status` - Error aggregation
- `/ops/smoke_test` - End-to-end testing

## A10:2021 – Server-Side Request Forgery
- [x] Input validation for URLs
- [x] Whitelist approach for external requests
- [x] Network isolation (handled by Replit)
- [x] URL validation in AI interactions
- [x] Timeout controls for external calls

## Additional AeonPay-Specific Security

### Financial Security
- [x] Double-entry bookkeeping principles
- [x] Transaction reconciliation
- [x] Fraud detection via velocity controls
- [x] Merchant authorization validation
- [x] Plan window enforcement

### Privacy Protection (GDPR/CCPA Ready)
- [x] PII redaction for AI interactions
- [x] Right to data export
- [x] Right to be forgotten (soft delete)
- [x] Privacy event logging
- [x] Consent management
- [x] Data minimization

### AI Security
- [x] Prompt injection prevention
- [x] PII access restrictions
- [x] AI response validation
- [x] Fallback mechanisms
- [x] Rate limiting for AI endpoints
- [x] Policy-based access control

## Security Incident Response

### Kill Switches (Feature Flags)
- `disable_mandates` - Stop automatic payments
- `disable_vouchers` - Prevent new voucher creation  
- `disable_swap_peer` - Block peer-to-peer swaps
- `disable_ai_nudges` - Turn off AI coaching

### Emergency Procedures
1. **Suspected Breach:** Activate kill switches via feature flags
2. **Data Leak:** Review privacy audit logs, notify affected users
3. **Financial Anomaly:** Trigger reconciliation, freeze suspicious accounts
4. **AI Malfunction:** Switch to mock coach, review prompt templates
